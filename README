Hello Congress tells members of Congress what their constituent's priorities are. A mashup of White House 2 (http://whitehouse2.org/) and the Sunlight Labs API (http://wiki.sunlightlabs.com/Sunlight_API_Documentation).

This is a brand new project as of Friday March 20th.  The goal is to have it live before the Apps for America contest deadline on March 31st.
