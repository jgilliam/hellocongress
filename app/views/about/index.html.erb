This website is a first step in solving two of your problems. The first is just managing constituent communications.  We can only imagine what it must be like in your office with the overwhelming number of emails and faxes coming in from constituents.  Since much of it is auto-generated by advocacy groups, it's becoming harder to manage, and increasingly less helpful to you.  Here you get a simple dashboard to track what your constituents want, and how it changes over time.
<p>
Second, your staffers are totally overworked, but they still have to pull together mountains of research and legislation. There's a very well-funded industry of lobbyists who've spent years developing white papers and talking points, and they're more than willing to help.  We think that over time, we can offer a better alternative, just like Wikipedia has built a better alternative to a very well-funded encyclopedia.
<p>
Think of us as a <b>citizen-powered think tank</b>.  In just a couple months, we've built a database of 1,700 talking points covering all sides of every important issue facing our country, and it's growing fast.  You can search this database, or just ask us to put together research for whatever you're working on.
<p>
It can be difficult to discern the ideology behind a lot of political information, so every talking point added by our members indicates whether it's supporting or opposing a given priority, and you can see how all sides of an issue rate it.  You can even see the author's own list of priorities, so it's clear where they are coming from.  It's an unprecedented level of transparency.

<b>Technical details</b>
<div class="small_content">
The site was built with <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> and uses the White House 2 API for the priorities, and the <a href="http://services.sunlightlabs.com/api/">Sunlight Labs API</a> for legislator information.  The source code is <a href="http://github.com/jgilliam/hellocongress/tree/master">available on github</a>, and is a good example for developers wishing to get started with any of those technologies.
